# Code Generator

This program will parse a custom programming language (can be changed from within the code very easily) into C++ code, which can then
be executed.
It can be used to allow people who do not have much familiarity with any programming to do basic tasks

----

The current commands in the custom programming language are as follows:
* PRINT - is parsed into cout from the std library
* @ - used to comment lines in the input
